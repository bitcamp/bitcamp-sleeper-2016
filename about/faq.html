<h3>What's Bitcamp?</h3>
<br>Bitcamp is a place for exploration. We’re a hackathon that values participant experience and mentorship over competitiveness and points. Come to have fun with your friends, learn something new, eat s’mores, and have a generally awesome time. We have all sorts of crazy activities planned for you...you’ll have to come to find out the rest!
<br><br><h3>What’s a hackathon?</h3>
<br>A hackathon is a creative coding marathon. Students are encouraged to come with an idea, form teams, and then build out that idea into a product in 36 hours. For Bitcamp, we want you to take something you love (sports! art! camping!) and combine it with technology to make something awesome. It is a great time to push the envelope and learn some new skills.
<br><br><h3>Where’s Bitcamp?</h3>
<br>Bitcamp 2016 will take place at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Y6CbkMAwLm72">Reckord Armory</a> on the University of Maryland campus.
